# MIPS_CPU
Implement a CPU which supports a subset of MIPS operations using Verilog HDL on FPGA Xilinx Basys 3

## TODOs
1. ~~finish construction~~
	* ~~`decoder.v`~~
	* ~~`BranchControl.v`~~
	* ~~`HazardControl.v`~~
	* ~~`RM_ctrl.v`~~
	* ~~`WM_ctrl.v`~~
	* ~~solving div function~~
2. ~~fully review the pipeline code~~
3. test
	* write a virtual memory
4. improvement
	* add cache
5. systhesis
